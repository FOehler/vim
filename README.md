# vim
Contains my configuration files to use vim in my IDEs / Visual Studio Code. 

## Rider
For rider with IdeaVim, you can use the .ideavimrc file. See a tutorial of how to use IdeaVim in JetBrains IDEs [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-product-as-the-vim-editor.html)

## Visual Studio Code / Cursor
Copy the content of the `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` to the appropriate settings file. These settings assume that you have the [vscodevim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) extensions installed. I would also suggest the [which key extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSpaceCode.whichkey)

## Obsidian 
To use vim commands in Obsidian, enable vim support in the settings. To also take advantage of the .obsidian.vimrc file, copy it to your .obsidian folder inside the vault, install the [vimrc extension](https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support) and set the path to the file in the plugin settings.
