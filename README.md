# vim
Contains my configuration files to use vim in my IDEs / Visual Studio Code. 

## Rider
For rider with IdeaVim, you can use the .ideavimrc file. See a tutorial of how to use IdeaVim in JetBrains IDEs [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-product-as-the-vim-editor.html)

## Visual Studio Code / Cursor
Copy the content of the `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` to the appropriate settings file. These settings assume that you have the [vscodevim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) extensions installed.
